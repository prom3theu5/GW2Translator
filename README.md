GW2Translator
=============

English to German Translation and auto paste into Guild Wars 2 Chat Window

WPF Application which takes a string, converts it to german / english depending on the option selected, finds the window for GW2
brings the window into focus, and pastes the chat into the text box automatically to make communication easier for those on foreign servers.

The translation is handled by Google Translate.

Keystrokes are sent via PostMessage (c++ PInvoked)

Its a pretty basic half an hour job in WPF but it works fine for what I needed :)

Hope it demonstrates some stuff to you.

enjoy.
